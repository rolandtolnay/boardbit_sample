## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **FVM (Flutter Version Management)**: [Install FVM](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation)
- **Firebase CLI**: [Install Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install FVM**

   Follow the instructions to install FVM:

   ```bash
   brew tap leoafarias/fvm
   brew install fvm
   ```

   _Note: Adjust the installation command based on your OS._

3. **Install the Flutter Version via FVM**

   ```bash
   fvm install
   fvm use
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   fvm flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Set Up Firebase**

   The project requires Firebase to run successfully. Use the FlutterFire CLI tool to set up Firebase:

   - Install FlutterFire CLI:

     ```bash
     dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
     ```

   - Configure Firebase for both development and production environments by following the [Firebase Flutter setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup).

   - The project uses two Firebase configuration files:

     - `firebase_options_dev.dart` for development
     - `firebase_options_prod.dart` for production

6. **Run the App**

   Run the app in the development environment:

   ```bash
   fvm flutter run -t "lib/main_dev.dart"
   ```

   _Note: The current environment separation solution is specific to this sample app. In a production app, the correct approach would be to have separate bundle IDs and configured flavors. This was outside the scope of this sample._
